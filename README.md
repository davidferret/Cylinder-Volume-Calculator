# Cylinder Volume Calculator

This C project is designed to help you calculate the volume of a cylinder and convert it into different units. The way it works is by taking the radius and height values you input, and then calculating the volume using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \). Afterward, the program provides the option to convert the calculated volume into units like liters, milliliters, cubic inches, cubic feet, or gallons. You can perform multiple calculations in one session, and the program will display the result with four decimal places.

I created this project to streamline volume calculations and unit conversions. Inspired by the need for quick, accurate measurements in various fields, I wanted to provide a simple, interactive tool that could help with repetitive calculations. This project makes it easy for you to quickly calculate and convert cylinder volumes in just a few steps.

## Example Output
```
Enter the number of calculations: 1

Enter radius (-1 to exit): 5
Enter height: 10
Volume of a cylinder = 785.3982 cubic cm

Select unit for conversion:
1 - Liters
2 - Milliliters
3 - Cubic Inches
4 - Cubic Feet
5 - Gallons (US)
6 - All Units
Enter choice: 6

Equivalent volume:
0.7854 liters
785.3982 milliliters
47.9222 cubic inches
0.0277 cubic feet
0.2073 gallons (US)

Program terminated!
